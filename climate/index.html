            <h2>Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change means long-term changes in Earth’s average weather patterns, things like temperature, rainfall, and wind. It’s mostly caused by human activities, especially burning fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and gas), which release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) into the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>These gases trap heat from the sun, causing the planet to warm, a process called the greenhouse effect. As a result, we see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rising global temperatures</li>
                <li>Melting glaciers and rising sea levels</li>
                <li>More extreme weather (like floods, droughts, and hurricanes)</li>
                <li>Changes in ecosystems and agriculture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Climate change is a big shift in how Earth’s climate behaves, mainly driven by human impact.</p>

            <h2>🌿 The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
            <h3>1. What a greenhouse does</h3>
            <p>A greenhouse is a glass building used to grow plants.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunlight enters through the glass.</li>
                <li>The heat from the sunlight gets trapped inside, keeping the greenhouse warm.</li>
                <li>This helps plants grow even when it’s cold outside.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. How Earth works like a greenhouse</h3>
            <p>Earth’s atmosphere works in a similar way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sun’s rays reach Earth and warm the surface.</li>
                <li>Some of that heat tries to escape back into space.</li>
                <li>But certain gases in the atmosphere — called greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor) — trap some of the heat.</li>
                <li>This keeps Earth warm enough for life to exist.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. The problem — climate change</h3>
            <p>When humans burn fossil fuels, cut down forests, and produce waste, we add extra greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This means more heat gets trapped than before.</li>
                <li>The planet warms too much — that’s global warming.</li>
                <li>Over time, this causes climate change: shifting weather patterns, melting ice, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So, greenhouses help plants by keeping heat in — and greenhouse gases do the same for Earth. But when there’s too much of those gases, the planet gets too warm, leading to climate change.</p>

            <h3>Flow of the Problem</h3>
            <p>🚗🏭 More CO₂ + CH₄ + other gases ↑</p>
            <p>↓</p>
            <p>🌫 Thicker “heat blanket” around Earth</p>
            <p>↓</p>
            <p>🌍 Too much heat trapped → Global warming</p>
            <p>↓</p>
            <p>🌪 Changing weather, melting ice, rising sea levels</p>

            <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Great question! These gases mostly come from human activities, though some natural processes play a smaller role. Here’s a clear breakdown 👇</p>

            <h3>🌋 1. Human Causes (Main Ones)</h3>
            <h4>🚗 Burning Fossil Fuels</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Examples: Coal, oil, and gas used for electricity, cars, and factories.</li>
                <li>Effect: Releases carbon dioxide (CO₂) — the biggest cause of global warming.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🌳 Deforestation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>When we cut down forests for farming, cities, or timber:</li>
                <li>Trees that used to absorb CO₂ are lost.</li>
                <li>When trees are burned or rot, they release more CO₂.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🏭 Industrial Activities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Factories release CO₂, methane (CH₄), and other gases from production and waste.</li>
                <li>Some industrial chemicals (like CFCs and HFCs) trap much more heat than CO₂.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🐄 Agriculture</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cows and sheep release methane when they digest food.</li>
                <li>Fertilizers used on farms release nitrous oxide (N₂O), another strong greenhouse gas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🗑 Waste</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Landfills produce methane as garbage breaks down.</li>
                <li>Burning waste adds CO₂ and other pollutants to the air.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌋 2. Natural Causes (Smaller or Temporary Effects)</h3>
            <h4>🌞 Changes in the Sun’s Energy</h4>
            <p>The sun’s output naturally varies, but current warming is too fast to be explained by this alone.</p>

            <h4>🌋 Volcanic Eruptions</h4>
            <p>Large eruptions can cool the Earth briefly (ash blocks sunlight) but also release CO₂ over time.</p>

            <h4>🌊 Natural Climate Cycles</h4>
            <p>Events like El Niño and La Niña can make some years warmer or cooler, but these are short-term changes.</p>

            <h2>Impacts of Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Climate change has wide-ranging effects on people, the environment, and agriculture. Most of these effects are negative, but there are a few positive impacts in certain regions or situations. Let’s go through them clearly and simply.</p>

            <h3>🌦 1. Impacts on People (Human Society)</h3>
            <p><strong>Positive:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Milder winters in cold regions, less need for heating, fewer cold-related illnesses.</li>
                <li>New trade routes in the Arctic as ice melts, easier access to resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Negative:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Health problems: More heatwaves cause dehydration, heatstroke, and spread of diseases like malaria or dengue.</li>
                <li>Extreme weather: Floods, droughts, and storms damage homes, roads, and cities.</li>
                <li>Water shortages: Droughts reduce drinking water and irrigation supplies.</li>
                <li>Migration & conflict: People may be forced to move from unsafe or unlivable areas, increasing social tension.</li>
                <li>Economic loss: Disasters and poor harvests reduce income and jobs, especially in developing countries.</li>
            </ul>

</div>

            <h3>🌳 2. Impacts on the Environment (Ecosystems & Wildlife)</h3>
            <p><strong>Positive:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer growing seasons in some colder areas → new habitats for plants and animals.</li>
                <li>Faster plant growth in some places due to higher CO₂ (plants use CO₂ for photosynthesis).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Negative:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Melting ice caps & glaciers → rising sea levels, loss of polar habitats.</li>
                <li>Coral bleaching: Warmer oceans kill coral reefs, harming marine life.</li>
                <li>Loss of biodiversity: Many species can’t adapt fast enough to temperature and habitat changes.</li>
                <li>Forest fires: Hotter, drier conditions increase wildfires, destroying ecosystems.</li>
                <li>Ocean acidification: More CO₂ in oceans harms shellfish, fish, and coral.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌾 3. Impacts on Agriculture (Farming & Food Production)</h3>
            <p><strong>✅ Positive:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer growing seasons in cooler regions (like northern Europe or Canada).</li>
                <li>CO₂ fertilization effect: More CO₂ can help plants grow faster in some conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>❌ Negative:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced crop yields in hot or dry regions — heat and drought stress plants.</li>
                <li>Unpredictable rainfall: Floods or droughts damage crops and soil.</li>
                <li>Pests and diseases: Warmer weather helps insects and fungi spread.</li>
                <li>Livestock stress: Animals suffer from heat and have less water or grazing land.</li>
                <li>Food insecurity: Lower yields and higher prices make it harder for people to afford food.</li>
            </ul>
